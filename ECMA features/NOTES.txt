ECMA Things: 

* Mostly to avoid using the keyword var and use let or const whenever needed.

* TEMPLATE LITERALS
 - ${"name of the variable"}
 - written in back ticks (``)

 * If there are more numbers passed than needed then the operator will 
 just take the amount of numbers that are needed.

 * const is more standard way of writing the arrow functions
